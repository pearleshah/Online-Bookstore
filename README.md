# Online-Bookstore

Simple online bookstore inventory management system that allows the user to add books to the inventory, remove books from the inventory, and search for books by various parameters.

## Files

* main.py: The main file for the online bookstore.
* bookstore.py: Defines the methods for the bookstore class, including how to add, remove, search, and list books.
* test.py: Test file that can be run to check the validity of the source code using a few unit test cases.

## Installation

Please download all the files to a folder. Within this folder, the 'src' folder and 'test' folders will exist. The 'src' folder will contain the bookstore.py and main.py files. The 'test' folder will contain the test.py file.

## Run Unit Test

To run test cases, open the terminal window. Change directories so that you are inside the folder containing the 'test.py' file. 

Run the unit test file using the following command: **$ python -m unittest discover test**

A separate 'data' folder will be created, containing the database.csv file, which will serve as the database for the online bookstore inventory management system. 

# Run Without Unit Test Cases

To run the file without test cases, change the directory into the 'src' folder where the main.py file is. From the terminal window, run the following command: **$ python3 main.py**

Follow the instructions as prompted after running the command.

Once again, a separate 'data' folder will be created, containing the database.csv file, which will serve as the database for the online bookstore inventory management system.
